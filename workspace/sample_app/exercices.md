## NPM

- Create a project with npm
    - of course, in a new folder
- Add a file to ignore node_modules 
    - of course, it need to be a git repository
- Install a library (one we saw previously)
- Import in in the index and use it. it should generate an output with console log("")
- Also add a nice message with console.log for the one who will later clone your repo
- Test and make it work with npm start
- Push on a new git repository
- Clone now the repository of one of your team mate and make it run (npm install then npm start)
