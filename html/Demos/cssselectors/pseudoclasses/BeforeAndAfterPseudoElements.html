		<h1>Interesting stuff</h1>
		<p>This is a paragraph with lots of text. I couldn't think of anything to say so I decided to list all the players for the Swans.
		First we have Vorm in goal, then a back-four of Rangel, Caulder, Williams, and Taylor. The midfield is a bit harder, we have Leon, Joey,
		Kemi, Gower, and Sigurdsson &amp; MacEachrey (on loan). The wingers are Scotty Sinclair, Dyer (for England!), and Routledge. Up front 
		the first choice is Danny Graham, with Lita and Moore as options off the bench.</p>
		
		<p>If you look carefully you'll see this paragraph is almost the same as the first one. I decided to list all the players for the Swans again!
