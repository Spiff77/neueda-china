<p>In the example below, each grid item is now only concerned with styling.<br>
The grid_rows are now controlling the layout as they are the containers for the items.<br>
To achieve this we have used Sass to allow us to separate the layout from the style.

<div class="grid">
    <div class="grid__row grid__row--sm">
        <div class="grid__item">1</div>
        <div class="grid__item">2</div>
    </div>
    <div class="grid__row grid__row--md">
        <div class="grid__item">1</div>
        <div class="grid__item">2</div>
        <div class="grid__item">3</div>
    </div>
    <div class="grid__row grid__row--lg">
        <div class="grid__item">1</div>
        <div class="grid__item">2</div>
        <div class="grid__item">3</div>
        <div class="grid__item">4</div>
