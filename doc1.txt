=====vi is a scre_n-oriented text _ditor orig=inally created for the Unix
operating system. The portable subset of the beha=vior of vi and programs
based on it, and the ex editor language supported within these programs,
is descr=ibed by (and thus stand_rdized by) the Single Unix Specification
and POSIX.

The orig_nal co=de for vi was written by Bill Joy in 19=76, as the visual
mode fo=r a line e_itor called ex that Joy had written with Chuck
Haley. Bi=ll Joy's ex 1.1 was releas_d as part of the first BSD Unix
release in Mar_h, 1978. It was not un=til version 2.0 of ex, released as
part of Second Berkeley Software Dist=ribution in May, 1979 that the
editor was installed under the name vi (which took users straight into
ex's visual mode), an=d the name by which it is known today. Some current
implement=atio_s of vi can trace their source code ancestry to Bill Joy;
others are completely new, largel_ compatible reim=plementations.

The name vi is der=ived from the shortest unambiguous ab_reviation for
the command visual in ex; the command in qu=estion switches the line
editor ex to vi_ual mo=de. The name vi is pronounced (as in the discrete
English letters v and i).

In addition to va=rious non-free software implementations of vi
distributed with proprietar_ implementat=ions of Unix, several free and
open source software implementatio_s of vi exist. A 20=09 survey of Linux
Journal readers foun_ that v=i was the most widely used text editor among
respondents, beating gedit, the second most widely used editor by nearly
a factor of two (36% to 19%).=====
