Declare some variables to represent the car you drive, 
or if you do not have a car â€“ a car you would like to drive!
 Firstly declare two variables called make and model, 
 then declare a variable to be the engineSize, 
 and declare a variable to be the gear your car is in.
 Now initialise those variables with appropriate values. 
 Put in some code so that the program will print out the values of these variables,
  things like; 
The make is xThe gear is yThe engine size is z 

You will need to use the string concatenator (+). 

let make = "Tesla"
let model = "Y"
let engineSize = 2
let gear = "auto"
let isStarted = false

let carStatus = isStarted ? "Started" : "Off"

console.log(make + " (Model " + model + "), is " + carStatus )

console.log("Hey I have a " + make + " (Model " + model + "), the gear is " + gear + " and the size is " +engineSize +"");

// Now using splice, in a team2 variable. Splice the first array so you
//  add in the second group the 2 last persons
//  
// ex:
//   original
//    team = ['a','b','c','d']
//
//   then
//    team will have values: ['a', 'b']
//    team2 will have values: ['c, d']

let team = ['a','b','c','d']
