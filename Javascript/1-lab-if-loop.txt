Part 1 Using if / else
In your previous script, firstly, put in some logic to print out either that the car is a powerful car or a weak car based on the engine size, for example, if the size is less than or equal to 1.3.
Now, using an if / else if, display to the user a suitable speed range for each gear, so for example, if the gear is 5, then display the speed should be over 45mph or something. If the gear is 1, then the speed should be less than 10mph etc.
 
Part 2 Looping
We will now need to generate a loop which loops around all the years between 1900 and the year 2000 and print out all the leap years to the command console. You can use either a for or while loop to do this.
Bonus (Optional) Once you have done this, set it so that after 5 leap years have been displayed, it breaks out of the loop and prints ‘finished’.

Part 3 Using switch / case
Now re-write part 1 to use a switch / case construct. It should do exactly the same thing as the if / else if construct. Don’t forget to use break.
