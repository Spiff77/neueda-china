					Querying using SQL
    
*/

-- Selecting Columns

-- Write a query that shows the city in which each publisher resides.


-- What is the price that each title is being sold for, and how many copies have been sold of each?


-- Which cities have publishers in them (it’s ok for a city to appear more than once).


-- List all the information known about titles.


-- Is every title sold for a different price to the other titles?

-- No, some are sold for the same price.



/*

					Expressions
                    
*/

-- Write a query that returns a simple address label for each store.  The format should be something like:
-- stor_name, stor_address, city, state, zip



-- Enhance your query to label the column appropriately; rewrite your query to use all three different syntaxes for accomplishing this.



-- Go back to your query that lists all publishers and their cities; change so that the "pub_name" column is instead called "Publisher Name", and upper case the "city" label also.



-- List the price of all titles if they were increased by 10%.


/*
	
				WHERE Clause
                
*/

-- Write a query that lists all business books (hint: look at the type column).


-- Write a query that lists the title of those books that have sold more than 1000 copies.


-- Now modify the query to list those books that have sold between 100 and 500 copies.  Re-write this query to return the same results but using a different approach. 


-- Find those authors that appear in the first half of the telephone book.  Write this in two ways, one of which should use a pattern matching function.


-- Are there any authors whose phone number does not conform to the American standard of "NNN NNN-NNNN"?  Write a query to return them if so.


-- Find those author(s) with a double-barrelled name.


-- Find those titles whose description includes the word 'computer'.  Capitalization is unimportant.


-- Find all business books costing 19.99.


-- Show those authors who live in Oakland, CA.


-- Find all cooking books (either modern or traditional) costing less than $12.  Write this query three different ways: using pattern matching, using OR, and then using a list.


-- Find those titles where there was no advance.


-- What is the revenue of all titles to date?  If the price isn't set, then assume it will sell for $9.99.  If the ytd_sales aren't known, then assume 1000 copies.


-- Show those authors who live either in Oakland, CA or in Berkeley, CA.  Write this query in three different (but equivalent) ways.


      
/*

						Functions

*/

-- How many characters are in the descriptions of each title?


-- What is your current user?


-- Run the following:


-- Inspect the newly created my_authors table:


-- Now write a query that extracts back out the author first and last names from the my_authors.name column.


-- When done, remove the table using:


-- Estimate the total sales for each of the titles in a year's time.  However, since you haven't any better information, guess that the total sales will be somewhere between 2 and 4 times their current sales (have the SQL do the guessing …).


-- What's 7^3?


-- Which authors have double-barrelled names? Don't use any pattern matching (ie LIKE) in your answer.


-- Find those titles whose description contains the word "Computer". Don't use pattern matching (ie LIKE) in your answer.


-- What's the time


-- What's the time in New York right now? 


-- Write a query that returns midnight for the current date. Make sure that the resultant column is a date, not a string.


-- Write a query that returns a timestamp (eg for a logging message). The format should be yyyymmdd.hhmmss.


/*
						NULLs, CASE
                        
*/
 -- First write a query that lists just those states in which there is a store, making sure that there are no duplicates.


-- Now write a query that lists all stores and their state, but show the full name of each state rather than its simple abbreviation (eg "Washington" rather than "WA", "Oregon" rather than "OR").


-- Create a table with some names in it


-- Check the contents using:


/*
Now, write a query that returns the authors name as it might appear in a library catalogue, eg:
"Dick, Philip K."
"Asimov, Isaac"
"Tolstoy"
Make sure that there are no extraneous spaces in the output.
*/


-- When done, remove the table using 
-- DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS names;


/*
				Sorting and Grouping
                
*/

-- List the authors by the state that they live in.


-- List the titles by type.


-- List those titles with the largest advance.  Don't bother to show titles with an advance less than $5000.


/*
					UNIONs
                    
*/

-- Create a temporary table holding those stores in California

-- Do the same for the other 3 states (WA, OR and MA).

-- Now write a query that combines the data back again.



/*
					Grouping

*/


-- How many titles have each of the authors written?  Just the au_id is enough to identify the authors, not their name.


-- How much total money has each of the publishers advanced?  Just the pub_id is enough to identify the publisher, not its name.


-- What's the average advance of each publisher?


-- Combine the last two queries to show both total advanced money and average advance for each publisher.


-- How many different (values of) advances have each of the publishers provided?


-- How many titles have each of the stores sold?  List the top sellers first.  Don't list those sellers that have sold less than 100 copies.


-- Find those:
-- titles costing more than the average price.



-- titles costing more than the average of their type



/*

						Joins
                        
*/
-- List the titles of every sale in any store in California.

 
-- How much total money has each of the publishers advanced?  Display the publisher's name rather than its pub_id.


-- List the titles that each author has written.

    

-- List those titles that have 2 or more co-authors, indicating how many co-authors there were.  Don't print out the author names.


-- How many titles have each of the authors written?  Identify authors by their first and last name (rather than just their au_id).  (Hint: use a group by).


-- List those stores that are in the same state as some other store.  Only print out stores once.


-- Show the names of the authors that have had (at least) one of their books sold in California.  (Hint: using group by)


-- Write a query listing all the publishers along with the number of stores in their state.


-- List those authors (if any) who live in the same city as a publisher of one of their books.


-- List all pairs of authors that haven't written a book together.


-- For each state, find the store that has sold more titles than any other in that state.


/*

								Subqueries
                                
*/

-- Using a subquery, list those titles that have 2 or more co-authors, indicating how many co-authors there were.  Don't print out the author names.


-- Using a subquery, how many titles have each of the authors written?  Identify authors by their first and last name (rather than just their au_id) 


-- Using a subquery, show the names of the authors that have had (at least) one of their books sold in California.

	
-- Using a subquery, write a query listing all the publishers along with the number of stores in their state.


-- List those stores that have no publisher in their state.


-- Using derived tables (subquery in the FROM clause), return those books that cost most than the average for their particular type.
